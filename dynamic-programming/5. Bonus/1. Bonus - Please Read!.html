<p>Congratulations on completing the course! We hope you had a rewarding journey with this course and it brought you in a solid shape to tackle the Dynamic Programming section of the coding interviews. We had put our sincere efforts in making this a well-balanced, top-quality, concise and an easy to understand course and we believe it served its purpose.</p><p>Just like Dynamic Programming, '<strong>Trees</strong>' is another very crucial topic to master for cracking the coding interviews. Apart from the coding interviews, studying trees is of uttermost importance in your journey to become a proficient programmer as they form the most fundamental and powerful data-structures that have countless practical applications. We would, therefore, highly recommend all our algorithm enthusiasts especially those who are really serious about interview preparation to conceptualize and understand Trees and boost up their confidence by solving the most frequently encountered Trees Interview Problems.</p><p>Keeping this in mind we have recently launched a thoroughgoing<strong> </strong>course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/tree-data-structure-and-algorithms/?couponCode=TREES_DISCOUNTED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tree Data-Structures and Algorithms</a>. The course has swiftly escalated the ladder of popularity on Udemy and has a <strong>current rating of 4.6 stars</strong>. We have spent a great amount of time in developing and organizing the content of the course taking into consideration that the learning should be as fluid and smooth as possible just like DP. The course features a thorough and an <strong>in-depth</strong> coverage of <strong>theory</strong> followed by a great collection of <strong>solved interview problems</strong> as well as well-chosen <strong>brain twister quizzes</strong> and <strong>coding assignments</strong> along with their true solutions (<strong>C++ and Java codes</strong>).</p><p>For our highly enthusiastic Dynamic Programming student community we offer our Trees course for just <strong>9.99$</strong> which is actually the lowest price that you can ever get it on Udemy.
